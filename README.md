# ColourGuesser

## Overview

This is a game I built for fun using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The game involves 9 squares that will change to random RGB colours.
The goal of the game is to correctly guess which square represents the RGB colour code that's displayed in the rectangle just above the 9 squares.
Each correct guess is 1 point and your score is out of 10. Users will be able to get more familiar with RGB colours and have fun at the same time. 

## Coming Soon...
The next step in improving this game would firstly be adding a HEX mode. This is already in the works as you can see from the top navigation bar in the game. 
I will also be adding different difficulties to the game (Easy, Medium, and Hard).
